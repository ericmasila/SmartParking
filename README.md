# Stepper-Motor-Keypad-control
A stepper motor is a brushless electromechanical device that converts electrical power into mechanical power. The synchronous electric motor can divide a full rotation into an expansive number of steps. The motor's posiition can be controlled accurately without any feedback mechanism.
Its construction is fairly related to that of a DC motor. It includes a permanent magnet like rotor which is inthe middle & it will turn once force acts on it
The stepper motor working principle is Electromagnetism. It includes a rotor which is made with a permanent magnet whereas a stator is with electromagnets.

The stepper motor has different driving techniques; 
    1. Single excitation mode - in this mode, every stator next to each other will be triggered one by one alternatively with a special circuit. This will magnetize and demagnetize the stator to move the rotor forward.
    2. Full step drive - in this technique, two stators are activated at a timeinstead of one.
    3. Half step drive - two stators will be switched first and after that third stator will drive the motor.
    4. Micro stepping - this is the most frequent technique. the variable step current will supply by the stepper motor driver circuit toward stator coils within the form of a sinusoidal waveform
